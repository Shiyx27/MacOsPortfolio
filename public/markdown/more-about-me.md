### 1. Automated Classification of E-Commerce Packaging for Open Box Delivery - (Under Review - IEEE Submission)

- Developed a transfer learning–based image classification pipeline to detect poor-quality packaging images (Blur/Dark/Random, Primary/Secondary Package).
- Achieved 89% overall accuracy and 96% recall for low-quality images using fine-tuned CNN architectures (ResNet50 + augmentation).
- Deployed an end-to-end automated workflow integrated with Google Sheets—allowing non-technical operators to run real-time OBD quality checks without coding.
- Reduced manual inspection overhead by 60%, improving packaging integrity assurance across last-mile delivery systems.

### 2. Swara-Net: A Deep Learning Baseline for Under-Represented Carnatic Ragas - (Under Review – TechRxiv / IEEE Submission)

- Curated a diverse dataset of 638 audio snippets across five ragas (Shankarabharanam, Revathi, Abheri, Brindavanasaranga, Mayamalavagowla).
- Designed Swara-Net, a 3-layer Deep Neural Network achieving 99.0% classification accuracy, outperforming SVM by 42%.
- Conducted detailed musicological error analysis of the model’s misclassification patterns and published the open-source dataset for reproducibility.
